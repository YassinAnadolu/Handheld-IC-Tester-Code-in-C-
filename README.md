# Handheld-IC-Tester-Code-in-C-
Designing device that can test an IC if its working or not and also can define what is the type of IC being tested and this only applicable for 40xx family.
Today Integrated Circuits are used in all digital device in a huge numbers, sometimes the digital device doesnâ€™t work well for unknown reasons, after checking that device carefully the problem seems to be from an IC used in that device. So to check the IC easily  we come to the idea of making an IC tester circuit which can test any digital IC before we use it in that device. In this report we are going to talk about our design for an IC tester circuit which is simply consists of: microcontroller (ATmega32), keypad, and an LCD. This design will let us to test any digital ICs consists of 14 pins and any number of ICs which is from the 40xx series within the constraints of the memory available. Because the ATmega32 is a reprogrammable microcontroller, we can expand the program to include other devices and families.
